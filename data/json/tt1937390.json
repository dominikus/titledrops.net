        "and five plus three makes eight, and eight plus five makes 13. Seligman VO The sequence has an interesting connection to Pythagoras' theorem and the Golden Section. It was all about finding a divine methodology in art and architecture. A bit like the way tritone, which was played on the piano in your little club, was supposed to be a satanic interval. The sum of the numeric values represented in Bach's name is 14, a number he often used in his compositions. Seligman: The clever thing about Bach's name is that the numeric value of the individual letters are all Fibonacci numbers. This piece has three voices: A bass voice, the second voice played with the left hand, the first voice played with the right hand. That is called cantus firmus or cantus firmus. And together, these three voices create the polyphony. Joe: Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as someone who can't get enough and therefore has sex with many different people. That of course is true, but if I'm to be honest, I see it precisely as the sum of all these different sexual experiences. So in that way, I have only one lover."
